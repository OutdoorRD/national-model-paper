Supporting materials and scripts for "A National Model for US Public Land Visitation" by Nathaniel H. Merrill, Samantha G. Winder, Dieta R. Hanson, Spencer A. Wood, Eric M. White.

## Status: Repository Under Development

This repository is currently being set up to house the supporting materials and analysis code for the research paper. 

**Current Contents:**
- `FIXED_EFFECTS_SEARCH_REPORT.md` - Comprehensive search report for fixed effects specifications
- `REPOSITORY_TEMPLATE.md` - Suggested structure for organizing analysis code

**Expected Contents:**
- Statistical analysis scripts (R/Python)
- Fixed effects model specifications
- Data processing pipelines
- Results and visualizations

## Fixed Effects Analysis

A comprehensive search for fixed effects specifications in this repository's history has been conducted. See `FIXED_EFFECTS_SEARCH_REPORT.md` for detailed findings.

**Summary:** No fixed effects specifications were found in the current repository history, as the repository currently contains only documentation files. The actual statistical analysis code containing fixed effects models has not yet been uploaded.

## Next Steps

1. Upload statistical analysis files containing fixed effects models
2. Organize code according to the suggested structure in `REPOSITORY_TEMPLATE.md`
3. Document model specifications and methodologies
4. Add data processing and validation scripts

## Contributing

When adding analysis code, please:
- Follow the suggested directory structure
- Document fixed effects specifications clearly
- Include model justification and validation
- Use consistent naming conventions
