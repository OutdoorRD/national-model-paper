NAT_016,Acadia NP,2018,3,23756,1,"The Sand Beach traffic counter along the Park Loop Road is flagged for estimation. The traffic counter failed to record 22 days in the month of March (03/01/18-03/22/18). Total recorded counts for Sand Beach (03/23-03/31) were 2081. Since there are over three weeks missing, we are using the daily estimate from a representative month last year. An estimate of 125-135 vehicles per day would be reasonable looking at the first three months of last year's data. To estimate the total traffic count, we used 125 vehicles per day on average and multiply by 22 days (counter was out). A little math... 125 average number of vehicles per day X 22 days out = 2750 vehicles. We know for the 9 days the counter was in service there was a recorded 2081 vehicles. 2750 + 2081 = 4831 vehicles estimated in the month of March 2018. Since this is an estimated number, we generally round the number so it does not look so exact. The number entered into Sand Beach this month is 4800.

Since there are over two weeks missing, we are using the daily estimate from April 2017. To estimate the total traffic count, we used the 390 vehicles per day average (April 2017 data) and multiply by 19 days (counter was out). 
A little math... 390 average number of vehicles per day X 19 days out = 7410 vehicles. We know for the 11 days the counter was in service there was a recorded 2525 vehicles. 7410 + 2525 = 9935 vehicles estimated in the month of April 2018. Since this is an estimated number, we generally round the number so it does not look so exact. The number entered into Sand Beach this month is 9900.

Traffic data for South Entrance is estimated. Traffic counter was inoperable from December 1-7 due to new counter installation. Estimated data generated by taking daily average from December 8-31.

Non-reportable, non-recreation, and bus numbers are estimated due to partial government shutdown. The park was open, but measured data was not collected. Estimates were produced using December 2018's most solid piece of data, the Desert View traffic counter. The counter showed a 3% decrease in traffic compared to December 2017. This was applied across December 2017 stats where needed to produce the December 2018 stats.

The counter showed a 13% decrease in traffic at South Entrance and a 10% decrease in traffic at Desert View compared to January 2018. This decrease was applied across South District and Desert View January 2018 stats where needed to produce the January 2019 stats.

A number of state highways were closed as well as large portions of interstate 40 from the night of November 26th thru the morning of November 29.

Data input was estimated close to the five year average which resulted in a 6% drop under last year’s traffic in that area. However, the O/I data at the cottonwood visitor center showed a 7.9% increase over last year; the traffic data estimated in the opposite direction does not follow.  Conversely the outbound lane counter at cottonwood functioned for all but one in the month of November and shows a total daily traffic for the month at 11,018. The average daily total (ADT) for Lane 1 with missing data is 400 and 380 for lane two, a 20% difference. The missing data occurred on days where visitor traffic was lower and if the data were present would likely bring the ADT of both lanes closer to the 380. Based on this, revising the lane 1 traffic to an estimated 10200 is a conservative estimate and brings the traffic data in line with the O and I data at the visitor center."
